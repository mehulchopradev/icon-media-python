OOP (Object oriented programming)

Real world            -             Software

: Actors              -             : Data (Objects)
                                        Object
                                          - class
                                            - From where multiple objects can be created
                                            - class has a name also which ultimately becomes the data type for the object

: Characteristics of Actors     -     : Attributes of the object

: Real world actor actions      -     : Methods (functions) called `on the object`
