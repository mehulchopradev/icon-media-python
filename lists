  - Aggregation, summarizing

- Data structure

- list
  - stores data together in an ordered fashion
  - store data of different data types - Heterogenous data
  - store data of the same data type - Homogenous data (Preferred)
  - allows duplicate data
  - After creating a list, it can be modified at a later point in time (add/remove/update)


- tuple
  - stores data together in an ordered fashion
  - store data of different data types - Heterogenous data (Preferred)
  - store data of the same data type - Homogenous data
  - allows duplicate data
  - After creating a tuple, it cannot be modified at a later point in time
  - Fast & thin data structure as compared to a list

- set
  - does not allow duplicate data
  - data in a set is stored in an un ordered fashion
  - After creating a set, it can be modified at a later point in time
  - It supports the mathematical set operations (intersection, union, A complement, B complement)
