  - Operations
  - Aggregation, summarizing

- Data structure

- list
  - stores data together in an ordered fashion
  - store data of different data types - Heterogenous data
  - store data of the same data type - Homogenous data (Preferred)
  - allows duplicate data
  - After creating a list, it can be modified at a later point in time (add/remove/update)
    - [Student data, Student data, ........., Student data]
    - [('mehul', 10, 'm'), ('jane', 23, 'f')]
    - [Student object(name, gender, roll), Student object (name, gender, roll)]


- tuple
  - stores data together in an ordered fashion
  - store data of different data types - Heterogenous data (Preferred)
  - store data of the same data type - Homogenous data
  - allows duplicate data
  - After creating a tuple, it cannot be modified at a later point in time
  - Fast & thin data structure as compared to a list

- set
  - does not allow duplicate data
  - data in a set is stored in an un ordered fashion
  - After creating a set, it can be modified at a later point in time
  - It supports the mathematical set operations (intersection, union, A complement, B complement)

- dict
  - It stores data as a key-value pair
  - key is suppose to be unique in the dict
      - 12: Student data
      - 21: Student data
      - 
      -
      -
      - 34: Student data
      - 56: Student data

      Index: 12, 21, 34, ......, 56

      Key % 10
      12 % 10 --- Bucket 2
      21 % 10 -- Bucket 1
      22 % 10 -- Bucket 2

      Search - 21
      21 % 10 - Bucket 1
  - After creating a dict, it can be modified at a later point in time
